Note that the BIOFIRE_API_KEY was added to GitHub secrets and is available as an environment variable in the .Renviron workflow as specified in workflow.yml.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(REDCapTidieR)
library(labelled)
```

Define the URL and the API key

```{r}
redcap_uri <- "https://redcapproduction.umms.med.umich.edu/redcap_v14.0.15/API/"

biofire_api_key <- REDCAP_API_KEY
```

Now get the data, and display first 6 rows.

```{r}
data <- read_redcap(redcap_uri, biofire_api_key)
head(data)
```

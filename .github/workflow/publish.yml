# note - if qmd not rendered to HTML,
# will not be able to publish to gh-pages, uses README instead
# currently uses most recent HTML render, does not render anew in GHA

# note2 - is not using the secret stored in GHA repo,
# not sure why - currently relies on secret stored in local .Renviron,
# so needs local render to be successful
